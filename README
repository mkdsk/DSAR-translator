This is a command line program that translates Nintendo DS Action Replay codes into readable C++ code.

Action Replay were cheating devices that were plugged into the Nintendo DS's cartridge slot that would read and write
memory to the game cartridge plugged on top of the Action Replay. They operated off of "codes", which were like
a mini-programming language that could be used to hack various parts of games. The user entered the codes on the menu 
and the started the game with the codes loaded. 

Example Action Replay code for Mario Kart DS that increases the player speed to 300:

6217ACF8 00000000 //if 0x0217ACF8 != 0x00000000 {
B217ACF8 00000000 //load offset 0x0217ACF8
000000D4 00002000 //set 0x000000D4 to 0x00002000
000000D8 00002000 //set 0x000000D8 to 0x00002000
000000DC 00002000 //set 0x000000DC to 0x00002000
D2000000 00000000 //set offset back to zero and end-if

This program isn't really useful, I wrote it because I wanted to learn more about memory.
